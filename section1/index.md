Part 1#: Assisted Transition: What could be missing in the Digital World?
Banking Is Digital, But Not Quite There Yet
We live in a world where almost everything is just a tap away. But when it comes to banking, things aren’t always that simple. Especially in lending, the process is not completely seamless.. Say home loan- still it has long physical/ digital forms, bloated terms and conditions, and endless documents. 
The Lending Experience—Then and Now
Back in 2020, when I applied for a home loan, all I had to do was sign a few documents and submit my KYC. The bank representative handled the rest, making the process simple.
Fast forward to 2025—if I were to apply today, I do have the option to go completely digital. But the digital experience is not smooth enough. 
I could complete it on my own, but it is: 
Time consuming due to lengthy forms
Jargon -Not every customer finds digital forms easy to use.
Endless documentation requirements. 
Hence I need to look up to the Sales representative who could help me to complete the lengthy form.
Even though processes have moved online, with banks offering 24/7 chatbot and on-call support. Yet, the banking process remains complex. Why?
